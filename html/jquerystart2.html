   <p>6.Unusual Seafloor 

The seafloor in Bermuda Triangle area is also found to be quite strange. There are some unusual formations. From a gentle slope it takes a sudden deep drop. In fact, some of the deepest trenches in the world are found in this area. Ships or planes that sink into these deep trenches will probably never be found as they are virtually inaccessible. 
 
Scientists also speculate that there can be large deep ocean craters on the sea floor of Bermuda Triangle. This can be caused by large amount of oil leaks or bursting of Methane gas that were trapped at different layers below the sea floor. Such giant craters (about half a mile wide and 150ft deep) have already been discovered at Barent Sea off the coast of Norway in March 2016. Similar such deep ocean craters are likely to exist in Bermuda Triangle as well because the sea floor in the area is known to contain large amount of Methane gas. If a ship is wrecked due to Methane blow out or any other reason and drops into the crater, it can easily disappear without leaving any trace.

   <p> Smart Water
Suffice it to say that the longer you shower, the more water you use. But just how much? Even if you have a "low-flow" showerhead, odds are your shower spits out 1.5 gallons of water per minute. A gallon, meanwhile, is 128 ounces, and so that shower spits out 1.5 × 128 = 192 ounces of water per minute. A typical bottle of water (that you might have for a drink, not a shower), meanwhile, might be 16 ounces. So taking a 1-minute shower is akin to using 192 ÷ 16 = 12 bottles of water. Taking (more realistically, perhaps!) a 10-minute shower, then, is like using 120 bottles of water. Deer Park, that’s a lot of water! Of course, bottled water itself is wasteful; best to use reusable containers when you can! But it does put into perspective what’s being spent in a shower!

Write, in a file called water.c in your ~/workspace/pset1 directory, a program that prompts the user for the length of his or her shower in minutes (as a positive integer) and then prints the equivalent number of bottles of water (as an integer) per the sample output below, wherein underlined text represents some user’s input.

   <p> Toni Morrison’s novels are always political1. Morrison’s seventh novel, Paradise,publishedin 1997, is no different. Jami L. Carlacio 
   maintains that Morrison’s work has beenan ongoing commitment to redefine (African American) personhood with the intention ofultimately producing 
   a new consciousness regarding race (xv). Beyond race consciousness,Morrison’s writing is indeed “a catalyst, a vibrant intellectual site, for 
   interrogating some ofthe most pressing concerns and contradictions of our world today” (Peterson 261-2). In Playing in the Dark (1992) Morrison
   discredits the view that “canonical American literatureis free of, uninformed, and unshaped by the four-hundred-year-old presence of, first, 
   Africansand then African Americans in the United States” (5). Morrison then makes visible theinvisible Africanist 2 presence in literature of
   the United States. Morrison argues that since theliterature she analyzes was not written by or for African Americans “the fabrication of anAfricanist 
   persona is reflexive; an extraordinary meditation on the self; a powerfulexploration of the fears and desires that reside in the [white] writerly conscious” (16-17).While Paradise addresses specific issues of race, gender, and history, this thesis argues that aclose reading of the text reveals Morrison making visible the invisible presence of the otherin the formation of the self.In Paradise, African Americans embody the same discriminatoryvalues as the dominant culture, Morrison in effect seems to 
   be deconstructing3 humanidentity itself - thus addressing the universal individual. Moreover, Mae G. Henderson pointsout
   that the process of constructing identity, rather than discovering identity, is central toMorrison’s artistic vision (Davidson 363).
   Paradise will similarly portray the constructed. </P>
