<p>The Bermuda Triangle has mystified people for years. Although this place has been clouded by numerous supernatural theories and rumors, today, it can be safe to say that we can have a plausible explanation behind the disappearances at the Bermuda Triangle

The notorious zone between Florida, Bermuda, and Puerto Rico?we've all heard about it! Some claimed the disappearances were due to the presence of extraterrestrial beings, whereas a few claimed the area is definitely haunted. One thing was for sure though, the mysterious disappearances had caused quite a flutter the world over.

Well, this isn't a plot of any film that will set your pulse racing. It is the Bermuda Triangle that has caused so many mysterious disappearances and still remains to be an obscure region for people all over the world. It gained a reputation as a place where many ships and planes simply vanished. 
Howard, an expert on Bermuda Triangle, claims that more than 50 ships and 20 planes have disappeared in the Bermuda Triangle over the last century itself, and up to 1000 over the past 500 years. So how did the planes and ships disappear? What went wrong? Actually there is no single theory that can explain all disappearances. The planes and ships have been victims of different circumstances & situations while cruising over the vast triangle area and were in different physical locations. And therefore there are several theories that explain the different incidents of missing ships and planes in Bermuda Triangle. 


Location
Also known as the Devil's Triangle, it roughly covers around 500,0000 square miles in the Atlantic Ocean. The apexes of the triangle are in the surrounding areas of Miami, Florida, Bermuda, and San Juan, Puerto Rico. It is rumoured that this is also one of the areas where a compass will point at the true North (Instead of the magnetic North). Hundreds of shipwrecks have occurred in this area.
There may be no actual map of the Bermuda triangle, and the mysterious stories that have shrouded this place are a result of scientific occurrences, some of which are yet to be explained. In 1964, a magazine first named this area as 'the Bermuda Triangle' (Writer ? Vincent H. Gaddis), and today, this area still continues to be the centre of attention for scientists around the globe.
