<h3>Hello</h3>
<p>Okay, let’s create a folder in which your code for this problem set will soon live. Toward CS50 IDE’s top-left corner, control-click or right-click ~/workspace, your workspace’s "root", and select New Folder. A new folder called New Folder should appear; rename it pset1, then hit Enter. (If you misname it or can’t seem to edit its name, control-click or right-click the new folder and select Rename to try again!)
Next, control-click or right-click that pset1 folder that you just created and select New File. A new file called Untilted should appear; rename it hello.txt and then hit Enter. (If you misname it or can’t seem to edit its name, control-click or right-click the new file and selectRename to try again!) You should see that hello.txt is indented immediately beneath pset1, which indicates that the former is inside of the latter. If hello.txt doesn’t appear to be inside of pset1, simply drag and drop the former into the latter.
</p>
<h3>manupulating the ide cs50</h3>
<p>Double-click hello.txt, and a new tab should appear within CS50 IDE via which you can edit the file. Go ahead and type something simple (e.g., hello or the ever-popular asdf). Notice that an asterisk () should then appear atop the tab, to the left of the tab’s name. That asterisk indicates that your file has changed but not yet been saved. Go ahead and save the file via *File > Save or, more quickly, via command-S (on Macs) or control-S (on PCs). The asterisk should disappear.
Okay, now let’s confirm via your terminal window that the file is indeed where it should be and start to familiarize you with that terminal window’s command-line interface. As before, your terminal window’s prompt should be
username:~/workspace $
by default, where username is, again, your assigned username. The prompt further indicates that workspace is the name of your "current working directory" (i.e., the folder that’s currently open within that command-line environment). The tilde (~), meanwhile, refers to your account’s "home directory," in which your workspace directory lives, but more on that another time. Note that this workspacedirectory is identical to that ~/workspace icon in CS50 IDE’s top-left corner (inside of which you created pset1 earlier).

<h3>Hello, C</h3>
<p>First, a hello from Zamyla if you’d like a tour of what’s to come, particularly if less comfortable. Note that she’s using the CS50 Appliance, the (non-web-based) predecessor of CS50 IDE, but not a problem. Any code she writes within the CS50 Appliance should work the same within CS50 IDE!
Shall we have you write your first program? Inside of your pset1 folder, create a new file called hello.c, and then open that file in a tab. (Remember how?) Be sure to capitalize the file’s name just as we have; files' and folders' names in Linux are "case-sensitive." Proceed to write your first program by typing precisely these lines into the file:
